## Multi Cursor

* `CMD + D` - Apply a cursor to the _next instance_ of the current selected text in the current file

* `CMD + U` - UNDO the last selected cursor

* `CMD + Shift + L` - Apply a cursor to every instance of the selected text in this current file

## File Navigation

## Find / Text Search

* `CMD + F` - find a string in current file.
