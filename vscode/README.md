# Visual Studo Code for Mac Tips

## Searching

* `CMD + P` - Search for files

* `CMD + T` - Search for symbols in open files

* `FN + SHIFT + F12` - Search for all references of a symbol in all open files

## Multi Cursor

* `CMD + Shift + D` - Apply a cursor to the _next instance_ of the current selected text in the current file

* `CMD + Shift + U` - UNDO the last selected cursor

* `CMD + Shift + L` - Apply a cursor to every instance of the selected text in this current file

## File Navigation

* `CTL + TAB` - switch between open files by selection

* `FN + F8` - navigate between errors / problems (as reported under the 'PROBLEMS' tab) in all files

* `CMD + OPT +T` - close all other files

## Breakpoints

## Text editing

* `CMD + C` - (_without_ selecting text) will copy the _entire_ line of text where the cursor is currently at. Cutting text works the same.

* `CMD + /` - comment out the current line

* `CMD + [ or ]` - indent / un-indent current line based on filetype rules
