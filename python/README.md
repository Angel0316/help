### NBConvert

Convert a notebook a differnet file format using `nbconvert`

```
jupyter nbconvert --to html working-with-code-cells.ipynb
```

More details in the [Nbconvert Docs](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

### Magic Keywords

NOTE: To list all available magic keywords using `%lsmagic` and run that cell in a notebook.

Some of the most popular [magic commands are listed here](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-8-magic-commands-in-jupyter-notebook-c1582e813560).

Run the Python debugger using `%pdb`

Time a function using ``

### Slideshows

You can create a slideshow from a Jupyter notebook.

First select the notebook type under `View -> Cell Toolbar -> Slideshow`.

Now, each cell can choose the type of slide that it is.

Slides are full slides that you move through left to right. Sub-slides show up in the slideshow by pressing up or down. Fragments are hidden at first, then appear with a button press. You can skip cells in the slideshow with Skip and Notes leaves the cell as speaker notes.

Here is an [example of a slideshow in a Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/2015-PyDataParis/blob/master/pandas_introduction.ipynb).

### Create a link to download a dataframe from a Notebook

Lets say you have access to a Pandas DataFrame `df` in your notebook but do not have the original file or the data in a file format at all. In this case you can save the file using `to_csv` function and use the `FileLink` module to display a link in the Jupyter Notebook to download it like so:

```
from IPython.display import FileLink
df.to_csv('mydf.csv', index=False)
display(FileLink('mydf.csv'))
```

You can also use this utility to copy a private folder to another location in a public workspace:

```
import shutil
shutil.copytree('../../data/project_1/', '/home/workspace/data')
```

### Lists

```
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', "Dec"]
q3 = months[6:9] #start index is inclusive , end index is exclusive
print(q3) # ['Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep']

first_half = months[:6]
print(first_half) # ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun']

second_half = months[6:]
print(second_half) # ['Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']

fishes = "one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish"
print(fishes.count('fish')) # 4

print('fish' in  fishes) # True
print('Sun' in months) # False

eclipse_dates = ['June 21, 2001', 'December 4, 2002', 'November 23, 2003',
                 'March 29, 2006', 'August 1, 2008', 'July 22, 2009',
                 'July 11, 2010', 'November 13, 2012', 'March 20, 2015',
                 'March 9, 2016']

# Get the last three eclipse dates: (two possible solutions!)
print(eclipse_dates[7:])
print(eclipse_dates[-3:]) # here the start index is 3 in then go to the end


sentence = ["I", "wish", "to", "register", "a", "complaint", "."]
sentence2[0:2] = ["We", "want"] #  replaces element 0 and 1 with this

numbers = [5,2,4,3,1]
min(numbers) # 1
max(numbers) # 5
sorted(numbers) # [1,2,3,4,5]

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b) # True
print(a is b) # True ('is' here same as '===' in javascript)
print(a == c) # True
print(a is c) # False
```

### Strings

**Interpolation**

```
username = "Kinari"
timestamp = "04:50"
url = "http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats"

print(f"{username} accessed the site {url} at {timestamp}") # Kinari accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats at 04:50
```

**Format**

```
maria_string = "Maria loves {} and {}"
print(maria_string.format("math", "statistics"))
```

**join**

```
new_str = "\n".join(["fore", "aft", "starboard", "port"])
print(new_str)

name = "-".join(["Garc√≠a", "O'Kelly"])
print(name)
```

### Tuples

```
AngkorWat = (13.4125, 103.866667)
print(type(AngkorWat))
lat, lon = AngkorWat # Tuple unpacking
print(lat)
```


### Sets

```
a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
b = set(a) # {1, 2, 3, 4}
b.pop()
print(b) # {2, 3, 4}
```

### Dictionary

```
population = {'Shanghai': 17.8, 'Istanbul': 13.3, 'Karachi': 13.0, 'Mumbai': 12.5}
population['Shanghai'] # 17.8
population.get('London') # None
population.get('Vulcan', 'City not found') # 'City not found'
```

### If, then else

```
season = 'spring'
if season == 'spring':
    print('plant the garden!')
elif season == 'summer':
    print('water the garden!')
elif season == 'fall':
    print('harvest the garden!')
elif season == 'winter':
    print('stay indoors!')
else:
    print('unrecognized season')

number = 145
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Number " + str(number) + " is even.")
else:
    print("Number " + str(number) + " is odd.")
```

### Loops

**for loops**

To simply loop use the iterable property like so:

```
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']
capitalized_cities = []

for city in cities:
    capitalized_cities.append(city.title())
```

To modify a list in place using the index then use `range` with `len` like so:

```
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']

for index in range(len(cities)):
    cities[index] = cities[index].title()
```

Another example: create username from a list of full names:

```
names = ["Joey Tribbiani", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Phoebe Buffay"]
usernames = []

for name in names:
    usernames.append(name.lower().replace(' ','_'))

print(usernames)
```

Yet another example: create a HTML list:

```
items = ['first string', 'second string']
html_str = "<ul>\n"          # The "\n" here is the end-of-line char, causing
                             # chars after this in html_str to be on next line

for item in items:
    html_str += "<li>{}</li>\n".format(item)
html_str += "</ul>"

print(html_str)
```

**for loops with dictionaries**

Using a dictionary with the get method to check for words and updating a word counter:

```
book_title =  ['great', 'expectations','the', 'adventures', 'of', 'sherlock','holmes','the','great','gasby','hamlet','adventures','of','huckleberry','fin']

word_counter = {}

for word in book_title:
    word_counter[word] = word_counter.get(word, 0) + 1

print(word_counter) # {'huckleberry': 1, 'gasby': 1, 'sherlock': 1, 'hamlet': 1, 'expectations': 1, 'fin': 1, 'of': 2, 'great': 2, 'adventures': 2, 'the': 2, 'holmes': 1}
```

When you iterate through a dictionary using a for loop, doing it the normal way (`for n in some_dict`) will only give you access to the keys in the dictionary

```
cast = {
           "Jerry Seinfeld": "Jerry Seinfeld",
           "Julia Louis-Dreyfus": "Elaine Benes",
           "Jason Alexander": "George Costanza",
           "Michael Richards": "Cosmo Kramer"
       }
```

Iterating through the cast dictionary in the usual way with a for loop would give you just the keys, as shown below:

```
for key in cast:
    print(key)
```

If you wish to iterate through both keys and values, you can use the built-in method `items` like this:

```
for key, value in cast.items():
    print("Actor: {}    Role: {}".format(key, value))
```

**range**

A quick note on range (which is defined as `range(start=0, stop, step=1)`):

```
range(4) # 0, 1, 2, 3
range(2, 6) # 2, 3, 4, 5
range(1, 10, 2) # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

Note to actually print these out use, for example: `print(list(range(4))) # [0, 1, 2, 3]`

**while loops**

```
card_deck = [4, 11, 8, 5, 13, 2, 8, 10]
hand = []

# adds the last element of the card_deck list to the hand list
# until the values in hand add up to 17 or more
while sum(hand)  < 17:
    hand.append(card_deck.pop())

print(hand) # [10, 8]
```

***break and continue***

Example: Write a loop with a `break` statement to create a string, `news_ticker`, that is exactly 140 characters long. You should create the news ticker by adding `headlines` from the headlines list, inserting a space in between each headline. If necessary, truncate the last headline in the middle so that news_ticker is exactly 140 characters long.

```
headlines = ["Local Bear Eaten by Man",
             "Legislature Announces New Laws",
             "Peasant Discovers Violence Inherent in System",
             "Cat Rescues Fireman Stuck in Tree",
             "Brave Knight Runs Away",
             "Papperbok Review: Totally Triffic"]

news_ticker = ""
for headline in headlines:
    news_ticker += headline + " "
    if len(news_ticker) >= 140:
        news_ticker = news_ticker[:140]
        break

print(news_ticker) Local Bear Eaten by Man Legislature Announces New Laws Peasant Discovers Violence Inherent in System Cat Rescues Fireman Stuck in Tree Brave
```
### Zip

zip returns an iterator that combines multiple iterables into one sequence of tuples. Each tuple contains the elements in that position from all the iterables. For example, printing

```
list(zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3])) # [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
```

For example combining two lists and looping over the tuples using a for loop:

```
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
nums = [1, 2, 3]

for letter, num in zip(letters, nums):
    print("{}: {}".format(letter, num))
```

In addition to zipping two lists together, you can also unzip a list into tuples using an asterisk.

```
some_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
letters, nums = zip(*some_list)
```

### Enumerate

`enumerate` is a built in function that returns an iterator of tuples containing indices and values of a list. You'll often use this when you want the index along with each element of an iterable in a loop.

```
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
for i, letter in enumerate(letters):
    print(i, letter)
```

or take a look at this example:

```
x_coord = [23, 53, 2, -12, 95, 103, 14, -5]
y_coord = [677, 233, 405, 433, 905, 376, 432, 445]
z_coord = [4, 16, -6, -42, 3, -6, 23, -1]
labels = ["F", "J", "A", "Q", "Y", "B", "W", "X"]

points = []

for l, x, y, z in zip(labels, x_coord, y_coord, z_coord):
    points.append("{}: {}, {}, {}".format(l,x,y,z))

print(points) # ['F: 23, 677, 4', 'J: 53, 233, 16', 'A: 2, 405, -6', 'Q: -12, 433, -42', 'Y: 95, 905, 3', 'B: 103, 376, -6', 'W: 14, 432, 23', 'X: -5, 445, -1']
```

**unzipping**

```
cast = (("Barney", 72), ("Robin", 68), ("Ted", 72), ("Lily", 66), ("Marshall", 76))

# define names and heights here
names, heights = zip(*cast) # note the use of '*' here

print(names)
print(heights)
```

Below we use zip to transpose data from a 4-by-3 matrix to a 3-by-4 matrix.

```
data = ((0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (9, 10, 11))

data_transpose =  tuple(zip(*data))
print(data_transpose) # ((0, 3, 6, 9), (1, 4, 7, 10), (2, 5, 8, 11))
```

Below we use `enumerate` to modify the cast list so that each element contains the name followed by the character's corresponding height. For example, the first element of cast should change from "Barney Stinson" to "Barney Stinson 72".

```
cast = ["Barney Stinson", "Robin Scherbatsky", "Ted Mosby", "Lily Aldrin", "Marshall Eriksen"]
heights = [72, 68, 72, 66, 76]

# write your for loop here
for i, name in enumerate(cast):
    cast[i] = "{} {}".format(name, heights[i])

print(cast)
```

### List Comprehensions

In Python, you can create lists really quickly and concisely with list comprehensions.

```
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']
capitalized_cities = [city.title() for city in cities]
```

Conditionals in list comprehension:

```
squares = [x**2 for x in range(9) if x % 2 == 0]
```

Note adding an else statement requires a little order modification like this:

```
squares = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x + 3 for x in range(9)]
```

another example:

```
scores = {
             "Rick Sanchez": 70,
             "Morty Smith": 35,
             "Summer Smith": 82,
             "Jerry Smith": 23,
             "Beth Smith": 98
          }

passed = [name for name, score in scores.items() if score >= 65]
print(passed)
```
